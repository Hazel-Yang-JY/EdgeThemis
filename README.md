# EdgeThemis

## Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for our project. To access the full codebase, please switch to the `master` branch, which includes the following key files and directories:

- **Dataset**: Contains the datasets used for training and verification.
- **Sentinel_Embedding**: Implements the embedding of the sentinel backdoor into the model for covert verification.
- **Verification**: Code for verifying the integrity of the models.

## Models Used

We have adapted and built upon the following models:

1. [Pedestrian Trajectories Prediction with RNN](https://github.com/Oceanland-428/Pedestrian-Trajectories-Prediction-with-RNN.git)
2. [Pytorch BERT SST2](https://github.com/awake020/pytorch_Bert_sst2.git)

Please refer to these repositories for the original implementations and detailed descriptions of the models.
